# [State management: React Query and context]
There are two alternative versions to choose for exercises 7.10-7.13: you can do the state management of the application either using Redux or React Query and Context.

7.10: [React Query and context step1]
Refactor the app to use the useReducer-hook and context to manage the notification data.

7.11: [React Query and context step2]
Use React Query to manage the state for blogs. For this exercise, it is sufficient that the application displays existing blogs and that the creation of a new blog is successful.

You are free to manage the state for logging in and creating new blog posts by using the internal state of React components.

7.12: [React Query and context step3]
Expand your solution so that it is again possible to like and delete a blog.

7.13: [React Query and context step4]
Use the useReducer-hook and context to manage the data for the logged in user.

Views
The rest of the tasks are common to both the Redux and React Query versions.

7.14: [Users view]
Implement a view to the application that displays all of the basic information related to users:
browser blogs with users table showing blogs created

7.15: [Individual user view]
Implement a view for individual users that displays all of the blog posts added by that user:

browser blogs showing users added blogs
You can access the view by clicking the name of the user in the view that lists all users:

browser blogs showing clickable users
NB: you will almost certainly stumble across the following error message during this exercise:

browser TypeError cannot read property name of undefined
The error message will occur if you refresh the page for an individual user.

The cause of the issue is that, when we navigate directly to the page of an individual user, the React application has not yet received the data from the backend. One solution for fixing the problem is to use conditional rendering:

const User = () => {
  const user = ...
  if (!user) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      // ...
    </div>
  )
}
7.16: [Blog view]
Implement a separate view for blog posts. You can model the layout of your view after the following example:

browser blogs showing single blog via URL /blogs/number
Users should be able to access the view by clicking the name of the blog post in the view that lists all of the blog posts.

browser showing blogs are clickable
After you're done with this exercise, the functionality that was implemented in exercise 5.7 is no longer necessary. Clicking a blog post no longer needs to expand the item in the list and display the details of the blog post.

7.17: [Navigation]
Implement a navigation menu for the application:
browser blogs navigation navigation menu

7.18: [comments, step1]
Implement the functionality for commenting on blog posts:

browser blogs showing list of comments for a blog
Comments should be anonymous, meaning that they are not associated with the user who left the comment.

In this exercise, it is enough for the frontend to only display the comments that the application receives from the backend.

An appropriate mechanism for adding comments to a blog post would be an HTTP POST request to the api/blogs/:id/comments endpoint.

7.19: [comments, step2]
Extend your application so that users can add comments to blog posts from the frontend:

browser showing comments added via frontend
7.20: [Styles, step1]
Improve the appearance of your application by applying one of the methods shown in the course material.

7.21: [Styles, step2]
You can mark this exercise as finished if you use an hour or more for styling your application.

This was the last exercise for this part of the course and it's time to push your code to GitHub and mark all of your finished exercises to the exercise submission system.
