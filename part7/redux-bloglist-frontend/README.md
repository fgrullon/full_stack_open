# [State management: Redux]
There are two alternative versions to choose for exercises 7.10-7.13: you can do the state management of the application either using Redux or React Query and Context. If you want to maximize your learning, you should do both versions!

7.10: [Redux, step1]
Refactor the application to use Redux to manage the notification data.

7.11: [Redux, step2]
Note that this and the next two exercises are quite laborious but incredibly educational.

Store the information about blog posts in the Redux store. In this exercise, it is enough that you can see the blogs in the backend and create a new blog.

You are free to manage the state for logging in and creating new blog posts by using the internal state of React components.

7.12: [Redux, step3]
Expand your solution so that it is again possible to like and delete a blog.

7.13: [Redux, step4]
Store the information about the signed-in user in the Redux store.
